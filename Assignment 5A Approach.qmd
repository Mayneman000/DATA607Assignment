## Assignment #5A

### Pre Coding- Approach

The approach for this assignment is pretty self explanatory but I first plan on copying the core data onto an Excel sheet and save as a CSV. Which i will load to R, I plan to collect the data. Then use the tidyverse function pivot_longer to set the table as a long format. I doubt tit will be clean at that stage so I will use filter + mutate to make additional columns that separate the value by on time and delayed as seen by the wide table given. Then finally create charts to express the % on time arrival for both airlines.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
